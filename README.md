# DCTLs
DaVinci Resolve CTLs 

This repo contains all the DCTLs I've created to expand resolve funtionnality (and also learn things).

## Sources and external docs

To learn how to create DCTLs, I've copied the developper documentation included with resolve v17 [here](https://www.notion.so/DCTL-Documentation-5932937de99c40e285d763284bc2d453)

### Dithering

- [Ditherpunk](https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/) : The most beautifully made introduction to dithering.
- [Low-tech Magazine solar website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html) : A website that runs on solar power, and dither its images to keep bandwith usage low.
